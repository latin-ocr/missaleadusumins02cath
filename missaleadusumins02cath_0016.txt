MSS. 21, 974, which appears by the arms emblazoned on two
leaves to have belonged to John Longland, Bishop of Lincoln,

celebration of the Mass, and the Benedictions of Archbishop
Peckham. The Use of the Ghurch for which this volume was
written was the Sarum. There seems no doubt that these arms
are those of Bishop Longland, and the only explanation I can
suggest is, either that this volume was copied from one belonging
to the Bishop of a Diocese whose Use really was Sarum, without
proper adaptation to the Diocese in which it was to be used, or that,
in the beginning of the lssth Century, the Sarum Use either had
been or was intended to be adopted in the Diocese of Lincoln.
