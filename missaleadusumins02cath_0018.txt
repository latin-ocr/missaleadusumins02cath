THE usn OF 8. Α8ΑΡΗ (5³).

In the Cathedral Library at Hereford is a Manual, which has
been most kindly lent to me by the Dean and Chapter, which once
belonged to a Church in Wales.

The MS. is of the middle of the l5th Gentury. The name of
the Church to which it belonged is repeatedly given on the fly-
leaves as “ Llan Vair Keric Kadrarum '' 01 “ Kadarum '² or
“y Kadarum.’' On the fly-leaves at the beginning and end are
extracts of the proceedings of Oourts held at Strad and Glyn.
There is also written on the fly-leaf at the end 2——

In Dei nomine, Amen, Ego Thomas ap J evan Gr. condo testa-
m(entum) in hunc modum: imprimis commend(o) animam meam Deo
omnipotenti (et corpus) meum ad sepeliendum in Ecclesia beatae Mariae
et sancti Kinec (2). . . . et ult(erius).

There is some difficulty in identifying Llan Vair Keric
Kadarum.

“Keric '' appears clearly to be “ Oerrig ''—the stones, probably
boundary or memorial. Two suggestions have been made as to
the place intended—-

1. That the name is a corruption of Llan-fair Caereinion or
Llanfair-yn-Caereinion in Montgomeryshire‚ near Welshpool,
which, in a map of North Wales, in Gibson's “Oamden‚'' pub-
lished 1695, 18 spelt Llanvaier Inkrenion.

2. That Llan-fair-yn-Cedewaen, or as it is spelt 111 the map
above referred to, Llanfair-yn-Kidriorn, 18 intended. This name
has been superseded by the English “ N ewtown.’'

“Strad'' for “ Ystrad‚'' ale„ stratum, street, and “ Glyn,'' are too
common as Welsh names to give any precise indication.

The name S. Kinec, of which only the last letter 18 doubtful,
and which may have been written “ Kinecii” or “ Kineciae‚'' as
two letters are missing, appears to represent St. Keyna, 0011011, or

Keyn; but 1 cannot find any church dedicated to St. Mary and
St. Keyn.

That the book was of Welsh Use is also shown by the Mass
for St. David, which I subjoin :-—-
