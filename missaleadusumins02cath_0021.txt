Catherine.

Besides which are inserted in a different hand, “ Festum de Nomine
J esu,'' the Mass for St. David as given above, for the Dedication

of a Ohnroh, and for the Purification With the “ Benedictio
luminis.''

There is therefore amply sufficient to determine the Use, which
clearly is Sarum pure and simple, with only the addition of special
office for S. David, just as the ‘⁶ Ripon Use '' seems to have con-
sisted simply of the York, with 011 office for St. Wilfrid, or as
probably almost every Churcb. had 0 special form for the Feast of
the Saint to whom it was dedicated.

At pp. 61 and 62 verso the MS. declares its “ Use ''—

Notandum est quod in ista proefcttioue nunquam dicetur, Per beatos
Evangelistas secundum usum Sao-isbum’eozsis Ecclesiae ; and

Ita tamen quod omnes po·oefittiones totius cmmz' sub hoc tono (licuntur,
sive propriae habeantur sive ozon, tam in Feriis quam in F estis secundeum
usum Sarum.

The Mass for the Dedication of the Church‚ which includes the
Sequence and the Blessing of Tapers 111 the Purification‚ Which are
added in the same hand as the Mass for S. David, are identical
with the Sarum Form-

The same is the case with the Canon, which-has a considerable
amount of rubrio.
