242 Kyrz'es.

In the Sarum Missal the Chants of seven Kyries are given,
and the full words, or the Verses, of nine Kyries are to be found at
the end of the Missal: six of these are in the York List. The
Hereford Missal has sixteen, including all those given or referred
to in the other Uses, and five peculiar to itself.

The Kyries of the York Use are here given from the Hereford
and Sarum Missals. I have added the Kyries of the Sarum and
Hereford Missals‚ and those found in MS. Bodley 775, written

sometime between A.D. 984 and 1017, a brief account of which
will be found in the Preface to this volume.
