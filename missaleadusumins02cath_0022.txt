xviii P‘reface.

The only differenee of any importanoe in the Earlier Offices in
the Volume is in the Servioe for Matrimony, “Vir autem stet a
sinistris mulieris et mulier a dextris viri,’' as in the Hereford
Form‚ and the “Manda Deus '' and Preces precede the giving of
the ring.

The forms of betrothal are—

Ich N. take the N. to my weddid wyf, for fayrore for foulore, for
riochere for porer, for bebere for wers, in siknesse and in helthe, forte
deth us (lepaite, and only to the holde, and tharto ioli plyztte my treuthe.

Ich N. tak ye N. to my wedded husboncl‚'for fayrore for foulore, for
richer for porer, for beter for wers, in siknes and in helthe‚ to be boner
and buxsuni in bedde and at bord and only to ye holde, forte deth us
departe, and ther to ich plitte the my trouye.

Wyth this gold ryng y ye wedde: gold and siluer ioh ye geue, and
{vith my bodi ich ye worsohep 3 and with al my wordelych catel I ye
lonoure.

An exact collation of these Offioes will be given in the Appen-
dix to the Edition of the ‘⁶ York Manual.’'

APPENDIX IV. contains a collection of what are there called
Proses, the Sequenoes of a later date, from a Troper in the

Bodleian Library, written some time during the reign of Ethefflred,
and later than the Canonization of S. Ethelwold.

This is certainly the earliest known collection of Sequenoes:
fifty-five of them do not appear in any printed collection to which
I have had access.

This MS. is the only English Troper known to exist. There
was once an English Troper in the Ohuroh of S. Bavon at Ghent. “
This is described by Pamelius in his “Liturgieon,'' and a few
Tropes are given. The MS. cannot now be found. It does not appear
to have contained any SequeneeS. The Bodleian MS. is described by
ΜΓ. Maskell, “Ritualia Ecclesiae Anglioanae‚'' vol. i. pp. xxxix-xli„
and very fully by Dr. Rook, “ Ohureh of our Fathers‚” vol. iii.
part ii. 20-28.

Ι have printed the Proses from this volume, as the earliest
collection of those used in the Ohurch of England, and also as there
appears good reason for believing with Dr. Book that a large
portion at least of these Proses were written by Alouin.
