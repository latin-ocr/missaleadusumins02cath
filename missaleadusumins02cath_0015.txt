Preface. xi

These variations would be abundantly sufficient to test any MS.
Missal of unknown Use, which gave the Sequences and the Ferial
Epistles and Gospels. Where these are not given, the only test
left is the Verse after the Alleluya 011 the Second Sunday‚ in which
Verse the York and Lincoln agree.

This is not an unimportant difference, though it would not at
all follow that a Missal with this Verse must be either of the York
or Lincoln Use. It is found in the second portion of the
York MissaL belonging to the Vicar of LeedS, which is described
Vol. i. pp. vii.-x.‚ and which portion is very possibly of Lincoln
use3 it certainly is not that of York, Sarum, or Hereford.

Another test may possibly be found in a case where the
Oalendar exists, by the date of the Feast of Relics, which at Lin-
coln, as will be seen below, p. 272, was kept at Lincoln on July 14,
though it is possible that the same day may be intended as in the
Sarum and Hereford Missals‚ where the F east is entered for the
Sunday following the 8th of J uly. It seems hardly possible, there-
fore, to determine a MS. Missal to the Lincoln Use, 'until one with
the Ferial Epistles and Grospels and the Sequences agreeing with
the Fragment has been discovered.

The matter might be left here, but there are two MSS. which
appear, or at least have appeared, to prove that the Lincoln Use
was only a variation of the Sarum, and only called a Use in the
same sense as the Ripon Use is spoken of.

These are in the Pontifical in the University Library of Gam—
bridge (Mm. iii. 21). This is the volume so much used by Mr.
Maskell‚ in his “ Monumenta Ritualia,” as giving the Sarum Use.
It is given in the Printed Catalogue of the Cambridge MSS„ from
the arms emblazoned in the illuminated borders‚ as that of John
RusselL Bishop of Lincoln, 1480-1494, and is cited as such in the
notes to the “ Translation of the Sarum Missal.’' There is no doubt
that the Use of the Diocese, for the Bishop of which this volume was
written, was Sarum. But it appears on further examination that
the arms are not those of Bishop Russell;* and a MS. “Transla-
