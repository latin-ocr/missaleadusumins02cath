Preface. xiii

are assumed to do so in this case, it will be found, I think, on com-
paring the Canon of the Mass, and the several Masses given in the
Appendix with the Sarum MissaL that there are scarcely sufficient
differences to indicate even a variation from the Sarum Use. The
same must be said of the Offices for Baptism and Matrimony.
But these two are mere summaries. They will be given at length
in the Appendix to the York Manual, shortly to be printed by the
Surtees Society.

The Office for the Burial of the Dead is peculiar and long.
It will be given in the same volume.

There remain, as given in the AppendiX, the Forms—

1. For Blessing Oandles at the Purification.

2. For Penitents 011 Ash Wednesday.

3. For Blessing Palms on Palm Sunday.
4. For Blessing Fire in Holy Week.
5. For Reconciling Penitents on Holy Thursday.

These vary very considerable from the Printed Sarum Missal, but
they are identc'cal with the Forms found in the Pontifioals of the
l2th Oentury, which, for reasons I have stated in the Preface to
the Surtees Edition of the “ Pontifical of Archbishop Bainbridge,''
I believe to have given the original arrangement of Bishop Osmund.

As to the Masses given in the Pontifical, the only variations
from the Sarum are—

1. In the Postcommunion of the Mass “Pro Sacerdote et Episcop0.”
2. In the Secret of that “Pro Sacerdote.‘’
3. In the Postcommunion of that “ Pro vivis et Defunctis.'⁷

The List of Saints' Days for which Episcopal Benedictions are
given is very peculiar‚ including those of the Founders of the great
Orders—St. Francis (Day and Translation), St. Dominio, St. Clair‚
and St. Bernard. Of these the Feast of St. Francis only is found
in the Calendars of the Three Missals.

I feel strongly inclined on the whole to the conclusion that this
Pontifical was compiled, or rather copied from one compiled, without
any reference to the Use of Bangor.
